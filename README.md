Cornell note taking has a very simplistic yet easy to use and study from after the fact of taking notes. Cornell note taking is used by students ranging from grade 6 until university. Cornell note taking form is used by students who are able to write less yet understand what they are trying to say in shorthand. Cornell is for students who can understand abbreviations. As for on the page setup of Cornell note taking is that on the left 30% of the page at the top it is used for main ideas, prompts, and questions. Furthermore, on the 70% of the page on the right side is used for Main points and details from class. Lastly, the bottom 5-7 lines at the bottom of the page is used for summarizing the class lesson(s) and or lecture(s) after class also at the bottom highlight important words and or sentences.

    <div id="Outlining">
<h3>Outlining Method</h3>
<p>To start off, the outlining note taking method uses headings and bullet points to organize topics. This method is most useful when learning about topics that include a lot of detail. The way the outlining method is used is that at the top left line is main topic one, then under that write the subtopic one, and then under that write key point one and then key point two. Every major topic of the lecture or meeting will be placed farthest to the left of the page. Subtopics will be added using an indent to the right. Each supporting fact or note is placed below the subtopic, using another indent.</p>

<p>Sukhman Gill:"I use the Outlining Method of note-taking all the time during Science Class, as I feel that it helps me remember the most and conserves the space that could be used for diagrams and the such.".

<p>The sentence method of note taking is essentially the normal way of taking notes. The normal way is that you just write the information in sentences. Though this is the most widely used way of note taking it isnt the most effective though. It may be effective if you are someone who can read sentences and just memorize the information like that. Furthermore, this method is especially good for people who sit through lectures and write quite fast and can also memorize sentences quite quickly this may be the method made for you. Though if you dont possess these qualities.

 <h3>Review</h3>
 <p> Ashveen Gujar:"I prefer the sentence method most of all, because as one can perhaps note, the sentence method is probably the quickest and most reliable in a rush. I always end up missing notes by writing too much, but this method makes sure I can stay focused and remember the information I need!". </p>
